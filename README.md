A README file is a crucial component of any software project, including a MATLAB toolbox, as it provides users with essential information about the project. Here are the basic elements that should be included in the README file:

### 1. Project Title
Explainable AI Toolbox

### 2. Project Description
The Explainable AI Toolbox provides a set of GUI-based tools for generating visual explanations using Grad-CAM and LIME, specifically tailored for ecological research. These tools help researchers understand and interpret the decisions made by deep learning models, enhancing transparency and trust.

### 3. Installation Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Add the toolbox folder to your MATLAB path using the following command:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('path_to_toolbox'));
    ```

### 4. Usage Instructions
To use the bulk Grad-CAM and LIME tool, run the following command in MATLAB:
```matlab
bulk_gradCAM_LIME_UI;
```

### 5. Features
Bulk Grad-CAM and LIME: Perform Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations on multiple images.
Single Grad-CAM and LIME: Perform Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations on a single image.
Masked LIME: Perform masked LIME visualizations on an image.
IoU Calculation: Calculate Intersection over Union (IoU) for given masks.
